# 🤝 Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for contributing!

## 🐛 Reporting Issues

Before submitting a pull request, make sure there is an existing issue describing the bug or feature.  
If not, please create one.

## 🔧 How to Contribute

1. **Fork** the repository
2. Create a branch for your changes named with the GitFlow strategy:
    - Feature branch: feature/\<story number>_\<developer initials>\_\<descriptor>
    - Bugfix branch: bugfix/\<ticket>_\<developer initials>\_\<descriptor>
    - Hotfix branch: hotfix/\<ticket>\_\<developer initials>\_\<descriptor>
3. Make your updates using the Conventional Commits nomenclature:
    ```
    <type>[optional scope]: <description>

    [optional body]  

    [optional footer(s)]
    ```

    The type is: **fix**, **feat**, **breaking change** depending on the type of the issue. Nomenclature must be respected
to allow automatic changlog generation.
The git commit message template can be found in [commit message template](../.github/gitmessage) and enforce with:

    ```bash
    git config commit.template .gitmessage
    ```

4. Open a **Pull Request**, and **link it to the related issue**
